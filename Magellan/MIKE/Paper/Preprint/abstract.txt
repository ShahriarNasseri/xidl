This manuscript describes the design, usage, and data-reduction
pipeline developed for the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE)
spectrometer used with the Magellan telescope at the Las Campanas
Observatory.  We summarize the basic characteristics of the
instrument and discuss observational procedures recommended 
for calibrating the standard data products.  We detail the design
and implementation of an IDL based data-reduction pipeline for
MIKE data (since generalized to other echelle spectrometers, e.g. 
Keck/HIRES, VLT/UVES). This includes novel techniques for flat-fielding, 
wavelength calibration, and the extraction of echelle spectroscopy.
Sufficient detail is provided in this manuscript to enable
inexperienced observers to understand the strengths and weaknesses
of the instrument and software package and an assessment of the
related systematics.
