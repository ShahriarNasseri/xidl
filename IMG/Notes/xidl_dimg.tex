\center{{\Huge \bf IDL Image Reduction}}

\begin{enumerate}

{\Large  \item Requirements:  }
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $>$300M RAM (this can be modified)
		\item the IDL coyote package 
		\item the Goddard IDL package
		\item the Schlegel IDL package (compiled)
	\end{itemize}

{\Large  \item Setup }

  \begin{Aenumerate}

    \item Create a Raw/ directory and put all the raw data in it.  Move
	to the directory above Raw

    \item {\bf xdimg\_strct} :: This creates the IDL structure which 
	drives all of the subsequent programs.  It also creates a fits file
	of the structure and an executive summary in the ASCII file 
	``image.dat''.  After running the program, one should 
	modify the resulting structure accordingly.  A brief summary of
	the structure is given below.  An example of this step
	is xdimg\_setup.pro \\
         \quad Example: {\bf xdimg\_strct}, n1\_strct, 'LRISR', 'Keck', /MKDIR\\
         \quad Time   : $<5$s per image

    \item {\bf distruct}

{\Large  \item CALIBRATIONS :: } \\
	Create Bias and flats including Super-sky flat.
	An example of these steps is given in xdimg\_calibs.pro.  You will
	need one set of flats but otherwise these steps are optional.
	For the flats, a non-linear correction is applied where applicable
	(e.g.\ SITe3)

  \begin{Aenumerate}

    \item {\bf xdimg\_bias} :: Create the Bias frame.  This routine ov
	subtracts the bias images and median combines.  It then deletes
	the ov images unless instructed otherwise.  Currently, the 
	'Tek5', 'Site\#1', 'LRISR' chips are supported.  Investigate the
	bias as you like (e.g.\ xatv, 'Bias/Bias.fits') \\
         	\quad Example: xdimg\_bias, n1\_strct \\
	        \quad Time   : 5 min

    \item {\bf xdimg\_dflat} :: Create the Dome Flats.  This routine ov
	subtracts the dome flat images and median combines.  It then deletes
	the ov images unless instructed otherwise.  It creates one normalized
	flat per filter.  Investigate the
	flats as you like (e.g.\ xatv, 'Flats/DFlatNR.fits'). \\
         	\quad Example: xdimg\_dflat, n1\_strct \\
	        \quad Time   : 10 min

    \item {\bf xdimg\_twiflt} :: Create the Twilight Flats.  This routine ov
	subtracts the twilight flat images and median combines.  It then deletes
	the ov images unless instructed otherwise.  It creates one normalized
	flat per filter.  Investigate the
	flats as you like (e.g.\ xatv, 'Flats/TFlatNR.fits'). \\
         	\quad Example: xdimg\_twiflt, n1\_strct \\
	        \quad Time   : 10 min
 \end{Aenumerate}

{\Large  \item Sky Flat :: } \\
	This is the preferred flat for analysis.  
	Although strictly a calibration file, this step is more interactivec
	than the previous and deals with the data images.  
	Ideally one has $>5$ well dithered images per filter.  The routine:

  \begin{Aenumerate}
    \item OV subtracts the object images (usually interactively with the /INTER 
	keyword) 
    \item Runs a gui ({\bf xmkmask}) designed to make sky masks (suppressed
	with the /NOMSK keyword). 
    \item It then median combines with clipping. 
  \end{Aenumerate}
    	The ov images are generally kept. The routine creates one normalized 
	flat per filter.  Investigate the flats as you like 
	(e.g.\ xatv, 'Flats/SkyFltNR.fits'). \\
        \quad Example: xdimg\_skyflt, n1\_strct, /INTER \\
	\quad Time   : 45min (masks), 10min combining

	\begin{itemize}
	   \item {\bf xmkmask} :: IDL gui for creating masks of a set of
	images.  Use the keyword /SKYMSK to create a skymask.  User
	can create rectangular, circular, and line masks.
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item Rectangle: LMB, LMB on corners of rectangle
		  \item Circular: LMB, LMB on center then outer radius of circle
		  \item Line: LMB, LMB, LMB on center of line, then one edge
			of the line and then the other center
		\end{itemize}
	After saving the first Mask, one can dither the same Mask on the next
	image using the dx, dy values [Note: minus signs require you type a 
	non-zero number first; this is confusing].  
	Set them one by one and hit return
	to update the image+mask.  Iterate.  Click on SVDITH when done or on
	NODITH to delete the current Mask.  You can then add new sub-masks 
	to the
	current image as desired.  The Masks are written to the Masks/
	directory by default and gzipped to save memory.
	\end{itemize}
	

{\Large  \item PHOTOMETRIC CALIBRATION} :: \\

	\begin{enumerate}

	  \item See xdimg\_stds.pro for an example.
	  \item {\bf xdimg\_proc } :: Process the standard field images 
		Identify all STD images with the {\bf where} command, then
		run {\bf xdimg\_proc}.   You will need to choose which image to
		flatten with and input the root name (e.g.\ 'Flats/TSkyFltN').
		The resulting
		images are in the Final/ directory with an 'f\_' prefix.  
		Note that this procedure
		also multiplies by the gain by default.  Make sure the 
		date is properly set for each image or is set globally! \\
  		\quad Example: STDS = where(struct.type EQ 'STD' AND 
			struct.flg\_anly NE 0 ) \\
	    	\quad\quad\quad xdimg\_proc, n1\_struct, STDS, 'flatroot', /DELOV \\
	        \quad Time   : Approx 15 sec / image 

	  \item {\bf xdimg\_starid} :: Identify the stars in each standard field. 
		This routine displays the image, allows one to flip it, 
		directs the reader to read in a star list relevant to the
		field, and then facilitates the identification of all stars
		in that field.  It is necessary, to 
		have the standard fields in the list 
		directory before starting this procedure.  Once you have
		identified and centered the stars, you can save the list
		which is convenient given the poor quality of the 
		Landolt coordinates and proper motions.  This program drives
		the program {\bf x\_starid} which is an IDL gui.  See its help
		page for more details. \\
		\quad Example: {\bf xdimg\_starid}, n1\_struct \\
	        \quad Time   : Mostly human labor ($<$1 min / image)

	  \item {\bf xdimg\_stdmag} :: Calculate magnitudes for the stars.  This 
		routine takes the star positions from the previous step, 
		reads in each image and calculates $7''$ aperture magnitudes.
		The output is written to Photo/ by default (mag\_*).\\
         	\quad Example: {\bf xdimg\_stdmag}, n1\_struct \\
	        \quad Time   : Fast, 5s/image

	  \item {\bf xdimg\_photcal} :: Derive the final solution.  This routine
		takes the magnitudes from the previous step, reads in the
		Landolt info, and then creates and plots up the solution.  
		One can set an AM
		term instead of fitting for it with the SETAM keyword.  Also
		the default is to only include Landolt stars with at least
		4 measurements.  This can be changed with the MIN\_NOBS and
		MIN\_MOBS keywords.  The output is written as 'soln\_*' in
		the Photo directory.  \\
         	\quad Example: {\bf xdimg\_photcal}, n1\_struct \\
	        \quad Time   : Fast

	  \item Checkout 'soln\_*' in the Photo directory for the final 
		photometric solutions.  The output given is the filter
		for the solution, the color, and then the ZP, AM, CLR fitted
		parameters
		with $1\sigma$ errors.  The final magnitudes are given by:\\
	
	 	\begin{center}
		Mag = 25.0 + ZP - AM*obs\_AM - CLR*obs\_clr \\
		\end{center}

	\end{enumerate}

{\Large  \item Coadd the Images} \\

	\begin{enumerate}

	  \item {\bf xdimg\_proc} :: Process the data images.  Make sure to set
		the correct flat root.
         	\quad Example: {\bf xdimg\_proc}, n1, 'flatroot', /delov
	        \quad Time   : Approx 20 sec / image  

	  \item {\bf x\_offset} :: This routine takes a series of images (in a list)
		and calculates the integer offset between number 2-n and number 1.
		It uses sExtractor to identify objects and then cross-correlates
		the images in a very simple way.
		Copy the default.* files from $\$$XIDL/IMG/Notes/files to a 
		new directory (e.g. '[obj]/offsets') and create a file lists the
		final images. The default output is a file 'offsets' with
		integer offsets.
         	\quad Example: {\bf x\_offset} 'obj.list' INSTR='SITe3'\\
	        \quad Time   : 1min/image \\

	  \item Combine! :: Use IRAF's {\it combine} to register the processed
		images.  Be sure to weight by exposure and scale by the median.
		This has the same effect as just summing each image straight-up
		(i.e.\ preserving total counts).
	\end{enumerate}

  \item Measuring Magnitudes

	We will use sextractor and in order for it to work properly
	the images must be in counts per second,
	have the same dimensions and be registered [these last requirements
	may no longer be true, I can edit the in-house code to handle
	different sizes and registrations].
	We will use the R band to select our images
	and set the aperture sizes.  We then will use an in-house 
	program to do the photometry
	
	\begin{enumerate}

	  \item Normalizing :: Divide each image by the value in TTIME in
		the header. \\
         	\quad Example: imarith Q0951B / 600.0  Q0951NB \\
	        \quad Time   : Quick 

	  \item Registering :: Either use the Gawiser method where you give the
		offset program the final B and R images and calculate the
		offset and repeat for I or just use your eyeball and ximtool.  
		Then use imcopy to copy subsections of each image into a 
		final 3 images which have the same dimension and are 
		registered. \\
         	\quad Example: imcopy Q0951NB[71:1839,86:2269] Q0951XB \\
         	\quad Example: imcopy Q0951NR[1:1769,1:2184] Q0951XR \\
         	\quad Example: imcopy Q0951NI[2:1770,3:2186] Q0951XI 


	  \item Run Sextractor :: Copy all of the default.* files 
	  	as well as the example .sex files from
		/home/xavier/Keck/LRIS/DLAImg/Sex/ into a subdirectory (Sex).
		Copy the *.sex files to the appropriate name.  Edit the *.sex
		files changing CATALOG\_NAME, MAG\_ZEROPOINT (this is the
		photometric zero point taking airmass into account), 
		SATUR\_LEVEL (55000 / TTIME), 
		SEEING\_FWHM, and CHECKIMAGE\_NAME. Finally, run sextractor
		on the frame for which you wish to identify objects and
		apertures.  We have been using R.\\
         	\quad Example: sex ../Q0132XR.fits -c Q0132+13R\_ap.sex \\

	  \item Run SBlimit :: Check the Surface brightness limit.  Create
		a file SBlimit.inp in Input/
		with (1) Npix in aperture e.g.\ $1''$,
		(2) Nfilt, (3-?) $b1, b2, XB$; $\sigma^{DN}$ repeat \\
         	\quad Ex: SBlimit

	  \item Run lris\_clrphot :: This program will parse the sextractor
		output and calculate mangitudes for BRI based on the output
		from sextractor.  The key is that the apertures are of a fixed
		size for all of the images.  Copy the input file 
		lris\_clrphot.inp from DLAImg/Input into your Input directory
		and edit everything.  The first 9 lines are the fits file,
		total exposure time (s), and Airmass for each filter.
		The next two are the aperture and catalog files from 
		sextractor.
		The last 3 lines are: (1) the number of dummy comments in the
		sextractor output, don't touch this; (2) the photometric
		calibration ($b1, \sigma(b1), b2, \sigma(b2), b3, \sigma(b3)$)
		and (3) the $1\sigma$ limiting magnitude which we will
		use in the case when nothing is detected.  The output is
		fort.11 which has: (i) running number, (ii) x\_pix, 
		(iii) y\_pix; (iv) Bmag, (v) Rmag, (vi) Imag, (vii) sex mag. \\
         	\quad Example: lris\_clrphot \\

	   \item Run lris\_3comp ::  In theory you are ready to rock.  Just
		copy over the lris\_3comp.inp file and get to it. \\
		\quad Example: lris\_3comp \\

	\end{enumerate}
	

\end{enumerate}
