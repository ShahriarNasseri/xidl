# Comments on HIRES ThAr calibration from JFH 2-23-2017

The hires_thar.lst linelist has been updated to use Michael Murphy's improved
linelist for UVES. Information about this procedure is here: 

http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~mmurphy/thar/

JFH added the red wavelengths to this list (previously only the blue wavelengths
were present.

The file thar_spec_MM201006.fits is also in this directory. It can be read in
and plotted by the routine XXX which is used for the wavelength calibration
in routine YYY.
